Their execution is less than perfect, garnering squeaks and clunks aplenty, but the vigor and enthusiasm with which they play makes up for any lack of proficiency. Being a hopeless romantic is all well and good, but Fiddler mice get so enthralled in their own playing that their trap reaction time is less than impressive.",

Although it will eat just about anything that it finds, it hoards cheese, guarding its golden ‘precious’ from any other mice that come near.",

Most of the time he is hidden away scrawling out masterful scrolls to steal luck away from hunters and grant it to mice wealthy enough to buy his services. He has been known to have a very refined palette and is said to only seek out the taste of Dumpling Cheese. This however is no easy mouse to catch, for though he looks old and frail, his lifelong practice of dancing with a heavy brush has kept him incredibly nimble and quick.",

No, you'll have to find some form of charm to attract them during a stampede - perhaps in the shape of their favourite food?<br>\n<br>\nAlthough they're cute now, Grubling mice that can secure enough food build themselves a charming little cocoon and slowly morph into the far more dangerous Scarab Mouse, so catch as many as you can now to help keep the population in check!",

Mice steer clear of him as best as they can, which is okay because he prefers it that way.<br>\n<br>\nThe short of all this, is that you'll never attract the King Grub to your trap without liberally slathering it with an appealing scent to attract him, and you'll never defeat him without heavily salting your trap for an added boost.",

How long would you persevere in the face of such disappointment?  And what would it do to you?  How would it change you?<br />\n<br />\nMany long years ago, Greedy Al was known simply as Little Albert, with many wishes on his Christmas list. Unfortunately, none of his letters made it to Santa so all those wishes went unfulfilled and after many years of disappointment, Al got greedy. So one year he decided that it was high time that he got what he deserved so he opened his own HUGE-box store in Gnawnia called the MegaBuy Mart with the slogan: \"Don't give this Winter Hunt, GET!\"",

The King Grub however, has refused to hatch for so long that the rapid transformation induced by the Shattering Charm caused him to mutate into a horrifying scarab monstrosity.  Much more powerful now, only the most foolish or brave of hunters would dare face this terrifying foe, but this transformation may have been for the best. If the Grub King were left to continue eating Garden Essences, he would have surely have been impossible to face later.<br />\n<br />\nYour trap will be a lot less effective against the Scarab King, given all of his armour. To face him you'll  need a lot more salt, not to mention an extreme disregard for your personal safety.",

Ah ha ha ha ha!\"  That laugh again.<br>\n<br>\n\"Look, sister,\" I said, stepping carefully closer.  \"I know you think you have a job to do, but I do too.  I'm here to bring you in, and you can come peacefully with <i>me</i>, or well, I know there's a few hunters around looking for you too, and you're gonna get poached if you're not careful.\"<br>\n<br>\nAt the mention of hunters, she flinched visibly. Her shell was crumbling, but breaking her so close to the frying pan was risky.  I decided to take it easier on her.  \"If you hand over the device and come along quietly, we can put you in the Hunter Protection Program.  You'll get a new name, a new house, a new job...\"<br>\n<br>\n\"No!\" she cried.  \"No new job!  Science, mad science forever!\"  Then she pulled another strange-looking device from inside her tinfoil jacket, thumbed a button on top, and threw it at me.  I ducked, there was a bright flash, and when I looked again, she was gone.<br>\n<br>\nAs my vision recovered, I noticed a trail of oil, nuts, and bolts leading away.  My keen detective sense told me she'd gone that way, so I decided to follow.<br>\n<br>\nShe couldn't escape me for long.",

While being agile enough to avoid most of the toxins and spillage, the small amount they were exposed to looks to have increased their body mass and speed while also providing excellent nightvision!<br />\n<br />\nThe piles of old clothing scraps near the spill location ended up absorbing the sludge, turning them green, which they quickly adopted as their new uniform.  With the added strength and agility, they are also able to keep multiple weapons handy on them at all times, such as chainsticks, long staffs, prong-shaped metal batons, and short swords.<br />\n<br />Even after discovering the secret of the ooze and gaining new powers, they are still humble warriors who never forget the wise words of their master: \"Remember who you are.\"",

As soon as he lit the celebratory firework rocking horse, he knew.  Immediately, the mask began to channel its lunar power directly into the rocket horse, sending it racing at high speeds.  With only one free hand he tries futilely to remove this ceremonial mask.",

Combining years' worth of mouse ethology gathered from the top hunters in Gnawnia, the best and brightest minds out of Digby and the top secret equipment held in Laboratory Room #54 resulted in this: the M400 Prototype.<br />\n<br />\nDesigned to adapt and camouflage itself as all known breeds of mice, it lives among them in order to analyze and document different mouse behaviours in the wild.  Advanced defences make it uncatchable to stay out of hunters' traps, and equally advanced weaponry defends itself against suspicious adversaries.<br />\n<br />\nThe perfect mouse... A little TOO perfect.  Once the behavioural modules went live, it became sentient, with the belief that it actually was a unique, wild breed of mouse!  It easily broke free and has avoided all attempts at recapture.<br />\n<br />\nThis \"new\" breed is next to impossible to find.   Recent sightings show that it seems to have made some improvements on itself and the M400 has been spotted in multiple regions simultaneously.  Leading us to believe it has some how figured out how to clone itself... What have we done!?",

On the plus side, the energy this mouse generates comes from a form of mist fusion, so it is always in possession of a bounty of Mist Canisters when caught.<br>\n<br>\nSometimes, when it thinks nobody is looking, this mouse pulls out a device with a big red button on top and stares at it long and hard.

There was once a scholar from Zokor who created magical guardians to protect the city's mysterious Dark Library. These guardians were powerful and kept the library safe... Too safe. This scholar, thinking he could claim the entire Scholar District for his own, commanded his guardians to prevent anyone from coming near the grounds. Much devastation was wrought and some of the knowledge stored within the library was lost before he could be stopped. When his plan was finally foiled, as punishment, his material form was divided and forever bound to his constructs in order to repay the city for the countless years of knowledge that was forever lost.",

    "description": "Once young and lively, this minotaur loved racing through the hallways of the Labyrinth, chasing down hunters and mice alike, howling and bellowing with delight as they scurried at the mere sound of his hooves on the cobbled floors. But now, it seems he has run his last lap of the maze, and has settled down into cozy end-life routines. Donning his fuzzy slippers in his favourite easy chair (which is a giant sack of gold), this retired beast has had his pension paid out in full and has relocated to his secret inner chamber to enjoy his retirement in peace and quiet.<br />\n<br />\nThe same shenanigans that used to bring him joy now only cause him grief, and he can be seen shaking his fist from atop his tower at the other mice hustling and bustling in the city. All that noise, all that racket! What a grumpy old grump this once playful beast has become...<br />\n<br />\nBut even in his twilight and seemingly endless misery, he still manages to let a small grin spread across his lips whenever he causes a mouse to jump in fear at the sound of his snort or the clipping of his hooves.<br />\n<br />\nNo one has broken into his private chambers and lived to tell the tale. Rumor has it that he stores many great and valuable items on opulent displays. Perhaps a resourceful hunter can find a way in and nab one of these rare treasures before being caught!",

As the Moussu Picchu Inhabitants below battle endlessly for dominance of the weather, the resulting stalemate allows the queen to slumber for generations.<br />\n<br />\nOnce, long ago, she would appear high above the land anywhere a lightning cloud hovered, visiting the many realms of mice across Gnawnia, her tail smacking the ground like lightning as she plucked treasures with it to add to her hoard. Now, countless decades pass in between sightings of the Mountain Queen, so much so that her very existence has gone from folklore, to legend, to mere myth...<br />\n<br />\nBut now, MouseHunters from the Kingdom of Gnawnia have found their way through the mountain pass, and their presence has brought a shift to the power struggle in these ruins, as they always do. Hunters have begun to harness the powers of both the Wind Wanderer and Rain Roamer tribes of mice in the area, ironically bringing unity between the two after endless centuries of feuding.<br />\n<br />\nAs the winds grow stronger, the rains fall heavier, and the storms begin to mix and clash, great bone-shaking growls can be heard from above the thickest of clouds, where the queen is said to reside. Is this thunder? Or is it the great Mountain Queen being rudely awakened from her slumber? Slowly but surely, disturbed by the intensifying battle in the lands below and the low rumble of impending thunderstorms in the clouds upon which she rests, she begins to rouse from her deep sleep...<br />\n<br />\nSoon, and without warning, Ful'Mina the Mountain Queen, will descend upon the lands with great fury to bring order to the chaos through the destructive force of her indomitable lightning storms.",

His first real commission as a professional tailor was to knit a magical scarf for Zugzwang himself. Realizing his talents, he slowly began to grasp the ability to weave the fabric of time itself, which was no simple feat.<br />\n<br />\nKey moments in history where fashion had an effect on crucial events began to reveal themselves....<br />\n<br />\nThe Time Thief Mouse realized that these pivotal points in time would be critical in shifting the balance of power away from hunters and more toward mice, perhaps thinking he could help to relieve their supposed plight. He had no choice but to tear the very fabric of time and step into MouseHunt's past to re-write history...<br />\n<br />\nIf this mouse succeeds, history as we know it will change and our way of living will cease to exist!",

It leaves one behind everytime it separates its reality into a new one, ducking behind the veil yet again.<br />\n<br />\nCapturing a Shade will temporarily stabilize the Rift, syncing the timelines, allowing hunters to keep their tenuous grip on their position in the tower for just... a little... longer...",

    "description": "This old, retired, grumpy gus of an engineer used to travel to warmer climes every winter to escape the cold. As soon as he felt the first chilly breeze of the season, he would hop on a westerly wagon to the Sandtail Desert. Until one year, just as he was about to set off for the season, the Festive Comet came crashing down and landed right on top of his wagon, smashing it to pieces, and leaving him stranded!<br />\n<br />\nThis mouse had meticulously planned his retirement around being <i>just</i> the right amount of warm all year; never too hot, and never, ever too cold. So much thought had gone into this lifestyle decision that he had changed his whole wardrobe to revolve around only wearing his favourite summer apparel: Shorts!<br />\n<br />\nStubborn as ever, he had put his engineering know-how (and most of his retirement savings) towards developing quite the sophisticated network of portable heaters to warm things up a bit! He was determined to make sure nothing would get in the way of him enjoying his retirement!<br />\n<br />\nUnfortunately for him, the MouseHunters of Gnawnia managed to destroy all of his heaters, saving the festive season from thawing too early, and leaving this cold-averse mouse permanently stranded and underdressed in the frosty winter weather.",

    "description": "This cold-hearted creature perches atop the tallest mountains in the islands where the air is thinnest and most frigid. It remains perfectly still, as though frozen solid, until an airship approaches too closely. Once the ship flies within reach, this chilling monstrosity takes one massive swipe with its mighty arms and hurls a barrage of ice and hail with such tremendous force that it can obliterate even the sturdiest of hulls. So many over-zealous treasure seekers have met this icy fate over the centuries that the island elders believe the mountains themselves were built from the frozen remains of ancient airships.",

The tear was hurled up into the atmosphere at tremendous speeds by the region's intensely shifting winds and was charged with supernatural fury by passing through the magical storms at the mountain's peak. The tear grew into the epicenter of this incredible anomaly of rain and wrath whose sole purpose is to enact a watery vengeance upon Gnawnian hunters who attempt to invade the islands.",

    "description": "This highly-sophisticated, expertly-constructed, and maniacally-designed tactical exoskeleton consists of gadgets and gizmos aplenty with whozits and whatzits galore! Its cutting-edge but dangerously unpredictable artificial intelligence system gathers data after every encounter and is constantly improving its response to unexpected stimuli. It is unclear whether the mouse inside actually controls this monstrosity or if it too is an unintended victim of the deadly machine's erratic programming.<br />\n<br />\nSome believe that its original creator is a brilliant but criminally insane mouse that lives in a hidden lab on the islands, collecting battle data, and improving its masterpiece remotely. While others have postulated that this contraption was actually the work of an ingenious but ill-fated hunter who tried to build the ultimate mousetrap but ended up creating something far more dangerous than the mice it was intended to catch.",

    "description": "Much like her Sky Wardens, the Empyrean Empress is more of an absolute force of nature than a mouse. She is a perfect balance of the raw energies coalesced from the eight power types found within the Floating Islands. Her powers are so incomprehensibly vast that it is believed that she single-handedly built the Empyrean Sky Palace using nothing but sheer force of will.<br />\n<br />\nCapturing her physical form is one of the greatest tests of strength and bravery for any mouse hunter but it is only a minor inconvenience for a being as mighty as the Empress. Her ethereal form is eternal and not tied to any singular existence which is what allows her to appear in all vaults within the Sky Palace simultaneously and perpetually.",

Some believe it is as old as the pond itself while others claim it is far older still. A being born from the darkest corners of the subconscious, meant only to reside in legends too terrifying to speak aloud. A being that could only be brought into existence by the awesome and transcendent power of the Folklore Forest.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tWhatever its mystical origins may be, the threat of the mighty Architeuthulhu is very real and very present in the deepest waters of the Prologue Pond. Fortunately, timid hunters can avoid the piercing gaze of its haunting yellow eyes by simply not wandering too far out from shore and staying away from inclement weather. However, hunters who are brave enough to take on this indomitable challenge must summon a storm as vile and menacing as Architeuthulu's wrath by arming Stormy Clamembert cheese. Once this volatile cheese breaks the surface of the water, Architeuthulhu will rise from its abyss with all of its valuable treasures in tow!",

Regardless of the ambiguous nature of her existence, she has proven herself to be a talented author and a compelling character so she and her trusty gander sidekick were must-haves for the Mythweaver's roster of literary talent. Her most famous works include: \"Little Miss Fluffet\", \"Little Bo Squeak\", \"Humphrey Dumphrey\", and \"Three Sighted Mice\".<br />\n\t<br />\n\tThis high-profile author has high-profile taste buds and will therefore turn her nose up at anything that isn't SUPER|brie+.",

    "description": "Many a cautionary tale has been written about the dangers of hubris but few are as poignant or consequential as the one being penned by the Mythweaver.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tThis once meek and meager mouse began its story as a simple Bookborn willed into existence by the maniacal Zurreal the Eternal. There was something unique about this particular manifestation however and it caused Zurreal to take special notice. This Bookborn exhibited more intelligence, intuition, and understanding than the rest of its kind and so Zurreal decided to share small fragments of his immense knowledge with this curious creature. As the Bookborn consumed more knowledge, its abilities began to grow and so too did its usefulness. Zurreal recognized an opportunity to mold and shape this exceptional creation into a powerful assistant capable of expediting his plans to conquer humans and mice alike.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tUnbeknownst to Zurreal, this creature was consuming knowledge at an unimaginable rate and before long, its intelligence and understanding had begun to surpass even its master's. This nameless creation eventually sought to have an identity of its own and, having developed a particular fascination with the countless volumes of folklore contained in the Crystal Library, began calling itself the Mythweaver. The Mythweaver began to recognize that he was merely a servant to an insane and tyrannical leader, a mere cog in a broken machine. And with that profound realization, this ethereal creature transformed into a unique and extraordinarily powerful mouse! On that day, the Mythweaver vowed to turn against his creator and become a true leader of mice; dedicated not only to their survival but to their supremacy in the land of Gnawnia!<br />\n\t<br />\n\tSo the Mythweaver scoured every inch of the great library in search of a means by which he could conquer the kingdom on behalf of his kind and one day he found what he had been searching for. Hidden inside a forgotten book on a forgotten shelf, the Mythweaver discovered a single page that Zurreal had missed all these years. This enchanted page was written by Zugzwang himself and on it he learned of a secret place of unprecedented power: the Folklore Forest!<br />\n\t<br />\n\tHe learned that deep in the Folklore Forest there exists a magical Book of Lore which contains the entire history of Gnawnia scribbled throughout its pages. What is special about this book however, is that if the words on these pages are changed then so too will history itself be changed. And thus began the Mythweaver's quest to rewrite history by writing the mice as the glorious champions and the humans as the vanquished foes!",

This deceptive dowager has a discerning palette and will only frequent fields that are at least mostly full of flavorful flora.

Seasoned farmers are all too accustomed to the ominous hum that precedes the coming of these predatory pests so much so that even the mere memory of it is enough to keep them up at night.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tThere is a famous and forboding passage in the Gnawnian Farmer's Almanac that reads:<br />\n\t\"When a sky of fire sings its tune,<br />\n\tA farmer knows the end is soon.\"<br />\n\t<br />\n\tOnly the bravest hunters looking for a formidable challenge should dare to face off against this frightening foe. However, fortune tends to favour the bold so those who do succeed in catching the Monstrous Midge will find themselves handsomely rewarded!",

But as the hunters celebrated prematurely, this brilliant baddie vowed never to rest until his conquest was realized and thus he began work on an even more dastardly plan. Rather than simply rewriting history, the Mythweaver would use his formidable magic to write himself directly into Gnawnia's most important tales and conquer them each from within!<br />\n<br />\nAnd so he began with the beloved Tale of the Bountiful Beanstalk in which a young hero defeats a greedy giant and restores the honour and riches that were stolen from his family. But where the original giant failed, the Mythweaver would succeed by making himself into the mighty and malevolent Mythical Giant King!<br />\n<br />\nNow the Castle in the Clouds that hovers above the Bountiful Beanstalk is ruled by the biggest, smartest, and most sinister Giant that it has ever known. From this elevated seat of power, the Mythweaver will crush the young hero who dares to climb his beanstalk and the collective consciousness of Gnawnia will never be the same again!<br />\n<br />\nPerhaps the fearless MouseHunters of Gnawnia can somehow find a way to insert themselves into this story and, with cunning, bravery, and a lot of luck, ensure that the hero fulfills their destiny by endowing this tyrannical Giant with a steep fall from grace!",

    "description": "It is not uncommon for an extremely passionate and tirelessly devoted artist to be viewed as stubborn. However, there are those who take that distinction to a whole new level. This very talented but completely unreasonable Oboist is one such musician who, much to the chagrin of the rest of the orchestra, has dedicated their life in pursuit of a single, very strange, and rather irritating goal: to master the \"infinite note\"! No one really knows how long the Obstinate Oboist has been siting there playing this one note but it feels like an eternity and no amount of desperate pleading seems capable of deterring them from this utterly asinine endeavour.",

This is his proudest creation as it embodies everything that makes the mice of Gnawnia fearsome, formidable, and destined for greatness. He considers it the perfect mouse and a shining example of why the Kingdom truly belongs to the mice and thus why the humans deserve to be written out of its history completely.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tThis astonishing creation is powered by the highly advanced and mind-bogglingly powerful Kilohertz Processors. These tiny devices imbue the M1000 with unimaginable might and it is believed that any hunter who managed to retrieve and activate them would be able to harness the power and luck contained within for themselves.",

    "description": "After losing his tenure at the School of Sorcery, the relentless and resourceful Mythweaver came to realize that fantasy alone would not be enough to finally defeat the pesky humans and their persistent MouseHunters. He realized that he would need something much bigger and more terrifying this time. He needed something that struck to the very core of human fear, that burrowed deep into the psyche of MouseHunters and awakened some primal terror that has remained dormant since the time of their most ancient ancestors. He needed something so great and terrible that it would instantly remind the humans of their lowly place in the hierarchy of species.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tAfter much searching, he eventually discovered a book much older and more primitive than the folktales he had been rewriting thus far. This book described a very different world with very different masters from a time long before the age of humans. A time that was ruled by fear and ferociousness, where only the mightiest and most ruthless survived and thrived; a time when mercy, compassion, and civilization were concepts yet to be discovered. T'was the time of dragons!<br />\n\t<br />\n\tThe Mythweaver studied the Tale of the First Dragons extensively and learned a most shocking and fortuitous discovery: the age of dragons had not ended, it was merely awaiting the beginning of its next chapter! And so, with quill in hand, inhibitions unfettered, and delusions of grandeur abound, he set upon that most villainous deed of penning the next chapter himself.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tHe followed the directions spelled out in the book and it led him deep below the Folklore Forest to a place that time forgot: the Draconic Depths. Deep within these coarse, cacophonous caverns, the Mythweaver discovered the hidden home and true origin of all the dragons in Gnawnia. Every great dragon that he had studied from the world above could trace its origins back to these dark and dangerous depths. From the furious flames of Kalor'ignis to the frigid ferocity of Icewing and all the way back to the great Dragon mouse itself. All of these legendary beasts once called these depths their home.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tHere the Mythweaver had everything he needed to amass the greatest and most terrible army of ancient monsters with which to lay waste to the human world above. So he used every ounce of his fabled magic to transform himself into the mightiest dragon of them all and named himself their Emperor. Now he intends to lead this legendary legion up to the surface and dispose of the human Kingdom of Gnawnia once and for all. That is, unless the strongest and bravest MouseHunters can face their fears and descend into these dreadful depths to put a stop to this heinous plan before it takes flight!",
